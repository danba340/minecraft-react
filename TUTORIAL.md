INTRO
In this tutorial i will teach you how to build 3d games or experiences in the browser.
And what we will build is a Minecraft clone.
The tutorial is in Javascript and we will use the libraries React and Three js and the package that
combines the 2, React three fiber.
I wont explain all the JS and React concepts to focus on the 3d aspects so some experience in JS and React is
recommended.
My name is Daniel Bark and i normally post videos in my own channel linked below. Enjoy the tutorial.
